# Global Power Plant Data

This is a repository containing data for global power plants. This data is being used to observe the trends and differences across different country's power plants.

This data is being used for a the course ENGL-105 at UNC-Chapel Hill. 

This data has been refined from the original published, the "Global Power Plant Database." The raw data was manipulated using Python

This repository includes the raw data, as well as the refined subset of data.


# Purpose
- The purpose of this data is to demonstrate the output of power plants in different countries across the world. This data includes different types of power plants as well.
- This data could be used by environmental scientists that are researching the efficiency of different power plants. Furthermore, this data can be used by any individual that may be curious in global power plant data.

# Data Source
This data was originally found from the World Resource Institute
- Research journal about how the data was collected and kept up to date: [A_Global_Database_of_Power_Plants.pdf](https://github.com/raiyah23/105-Unit-3/files/10100907/A_Global_Database_of_Power_Plants.pdf)

# Data Use
- This data can be used in many different ways as there are many variables present. For example, the data can be looked at by country, or it can be looked at by type of energy source.
- This data could be used to see what a specific country may use as their main source of power.
- This data could also be used to determine which source of energy has the most outputs.

An example of how this data can be used is seen below.
- Here, this data shows the output of hydro power plants in Australia across the years.
